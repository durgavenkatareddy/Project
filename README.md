# Project
# HR Analytics - Predict Employee Attrition

##  Objective
This project aims to leverage data analytics and machine learning to:
- Understand the main causes of employee resignations.
- Predict future employee attrition using historical HR data.

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Data preprocessing, EDA, and model building.
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `shap`, `matplotlib`
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard for visualizing attrition trends and insights.
- **Jupyter Notebook **: Development environment.

### 1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze department-wise attrition rates.
- Explore attrition trends across salary bands.
- Examine correlation between promotions and attrition.
- Visualize key patterns using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.

### 2. Build Classification Model
- Choose either:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
- Train model to classify if an employee is likely to leave.
- Evaluate model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

### 3. Interpret Model Predictions
- Use SHAP to explain model output.
- Identify features most influencing attrition.

### 4. Build Power BI Dashboard
- Import cleaned data and model outputs.
- Visualize:
  - Attrition by department/salary/promotion
  - Key factors driving resignation
  - Predictive insights from model

##  Deliverables
-  **Power BI Dashboard**: Interactive visual analytics on employee attrition.
-  **Model Accuracy Report**: Evaluation metrics and confusion matrix.
-  **Attrition Prevention PDF**: Key findings and actionable recommendations to reduce attrition.
